/**
 * Lightweight, Compose-first MVI toolkit for Kotlin Multiplatform.
 *
 * This file defines the small set of primitives used to build unidirectional data flows:
 * - Reducer: a pure function that transforms (State, Event) -> State
 * - SideEffect: a suspend function that reacts to an Event and State (e.g., I/O, navigation)
 * - Interactor: a coordinator that merges a source Flow<State> with dispatched events,
 *   applying reducers to produce a StateFlow<State> and running side effects after each reduction.
 * - rememberInteractor: a Compose helper that wires an Interactor to a Composable lifecycle and
 *   persists its State via rememberSaveable using kotlinx.serialization.
 *
 * The goal is to provide an ergonomically small surface area that works across KMP targets while
 * staying framework-agnostic and easy to embed.

 * Guidelines:
 * - Should be side-effect free; do not perform I/O here. Use [SideEffect] for that.
 * - Prefer immutability; return a copy of state with changed fields.

 * - Fire-and-forget operations (analytics, logging)

 * - Navigation requests

 * - Side effects should not mutate the state directly; communicate via new events.
